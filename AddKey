If you try to install a package after this pacman, there is a problem that the package will be rejected as untrusted.

error: <package>: signature from "Arch Linux ARM Build System <builder@archlinuxarm.org>" is marginal trust
After spending a few hours trying to figure this out, I found that the problem was that the "Arch Linux ARM Build System" key was not trusted.

[root@honearch keyrings]# pacman-key --list-sigs Build

pacman-key --list-sigsCheck the key ID.
Specify the argument Buildand try to hit "Arch Linux ARM Build System". You can see that
the status is marginal(Limited).

marginalfullIt has changed from to .
Now Arch Linux ARM Build will trust signed packages.

Arch Linux ARM packages verify the keys using the keyring installed in 2-2. Installing required packages . I understand that just installing the keyring does not mean that it is completely trusted, and that a local signature needs to be added in .archlinuxarm-keyring
